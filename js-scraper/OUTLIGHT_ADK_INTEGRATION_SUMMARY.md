- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and performance metrics

## 🔧 Technical Details

### **New ADK Agent**
```typescript
this.agents.outlightScraper = new LlmAgent({
  name: 'outlight_scraper',
  model: 'gemini-2.5-flash',
  instruction: `You are an Outlight.fun data discovery specialist...`,
  tools: [
    new OutlightScrapingTool(this.supabase),
    new ChannelDiscoveryTool(),
    new MessageExtractionTool(),
    new DataValidationTool()
  ]
});
```

### **Custom Tool Implementation**
```typescript
class OutlightScrapingTool {
  async execute(input) {
    const scraper = new OutlightScraper();
    await scraper.main();
    return { success: true, message: 'Outlight.fun scraping completed successfully' };
  }
}
```

### **Updated Workflow**
```typescript
this.workflow = await AgentBuilder.create('iris_memecoin_pipeline')
  .asSequential([
    this.agents.marketDataFetcher,    // Step 1: Fetch latest market data
    this.agents.tiktokScraper,        // Step 2: Scrape TikTok content
    this.agents.telegramScraper,      // Step 3: Scrape existing Telegram channels
    this.agents.outlightScraper,      // Step 4: Discover new channels from Outlight.fun ⭐
    this.agents.patternAnalyzer,      // Step 5: Analyze patterns and correlations
    this.agents.twitterAlerts,        // Step 6: Generate and post alerts
    this.agents.dashboardUpdater      // Step 7: Update frontend dashboard
  ])
  .build();
```

## 📈 Expected Results

### **Channel Discovery**
- Discovers Telegram channels mentioned on Outlight.fun
- Stores channel metadata in `telegram_channels` table
- Enables automated monitoring of discovered channels

### **Message Collection**
